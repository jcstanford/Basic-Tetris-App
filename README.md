# Basic-Tetris-App

I would like to make a basic Tetris game that will demonstrate my ability to learn something new, fix bugs in it, and even make improvements upon it. I'm a Javascript beginner, so I followed along a Youtube tutorial from @Meth-Meth-Method.

The guide uses Javascript with HTML5 bones to build a basic Tetris game.

I've worked with Python and SQL before, which make sense to me. Javascript, however, has always been the hardest language for me to understand in my early days of being a programmer. Completing more projects and/or games with JS will be my best bet for improving my understanding of it.
